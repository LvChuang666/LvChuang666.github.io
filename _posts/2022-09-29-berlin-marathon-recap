excerpt: Some summaries and lessons of my Berlin Marathon 2022.
---

I completed the berlin marathon last week Sunday. 
It was my second marathon, and this time I finished in 3h38m30s, 29minutes faster than the first time.

Below are my race summaries and lessons.

Before the race:
* It was the first time for me to attend such a big race, so I could not resist the temptation to go around during the expo… I ended up spending too much time on my feet the days before the race. For example, I waited in long queues to take a photo in front of some nice poster wall; I spent lots of time chatting with friends while standing without noticing… 

* What made the above worse, is that I wore my barefoot shoes to the race weekend. I didnot pay much attention, until at the end of the day I felt the bottom of the feet started to have some serious soreness. I did see many people wearing running shoes during the expo (even super shoes). I did not understand that until I felt my feet… Next time during race weekend, I will definitely minimise the time on my feet and wear some thing much more comfortable.

During the race:
* I planned to keep the heart rate to 10 beats above MAF HR  (145+10) during the first half. I heard many times from the PB program or from earlier PB zoom calls, that there always can be something unexpected happening during race day. And my heart rate monitor went ballistic on me very soon after starting. It just went from normal to a very low reading, 90-ish. This never happened to me. As a result I just ran by feel for quite some time, until the HR monitor somehow recovered. Then I see my heart rate is already 20 beats above my MAF HR (145+20) … I managed to bring down to about 160, and I felt (probably with the race nerve…) that I can maintain that intensity and pace, so I kind of abandoned my original plan and ran at a higher intensity in the first half. This made me feel the tiredness in the legs from the 21km already. I kept pushing, but I had to drop speed from 33km onwards, while the heart rate just kept going up (all the way to 175). If I had more intensity discipline at the beginning, I most likely could finish with less fatigue, and maybe even a better time. 

* My shoes turned out to be too small… I did wear them for about 80km during training, but I never wore them for longs runs. The shoe being a little bit small didn’t bother me for the runs up to 15km. But for a marathon the ‘little bit small’ did make some trouble. I felt the toes hurting from mid way. I just ignored it during the rest of the race. Only afterwards I saw few toe nails turned completely purple. Make sure the shoes are about a finger width larger, especially for long distance running.

* Fortunately, I didn’t hit the wall in the end. But there were moments I was quite worried that I might hit the limit—the negative thoughts popped up. Especially when the legs being very heavy, I doubt whether I can hold till the end. I did a few things which helped me overcome those tough moments: I talked to my self, such as “shut up, leg!” ( learned from <Endure>), “How amazing to be here and run here! Just enjoy every moment.”; I wrote the names of the beloved family members on my hand, and reminded myself; I also found that clapping hand to myself is also super useful, I immediately felt refreshed.

* BTW, a small trick regarding drinking from water cups:

 I happened to read this trick before my race, and I tried it during the race, it worked like a charm for me. I managed to keep the pace while accessing the water points, and hydrate quite well. 

* I had six Maurten gels, three with caffeine. Close to the end of the race, I felt disgusted while having the last two gels. Maybe I should eat something solid (like banana), or maybe I should use gels with some flavor at the end (Maurten has almost no flavor) .  
 

After the race:
I really pushed my self this time. With high HR, the lactic acid built up significantly. Immediately after the race I felt my legs were not mine any more. They were so sore. I could not walk normal, and I had to keep my knees un-bent to feel less pain. Not mention walking down stairs: I have to hold the handle, controlled completely by my arms and literally jump down. 

On the other hand, I felt good about the pain (as long as I did not injure my self). It is kind of a ‘proud pain’.  It is a proof that you tried hard to probe the limit of yourself, and you eventually succeeded. 

All in all, the best thing about running a marathon to me is: 

There is pain and suffering, however strong they may be, but at the moment when I cross the finish line, they all disappear immediately, and instead, the moment is full of joy, achievement and happiness. 

It is exactly the pain and suffering that will make all the latter feelings so strong.
